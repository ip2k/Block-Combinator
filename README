Block Combinator is a simple PHP application with one goal in mind: make URLs that combine multiple blocklists 
into a nice single gzipped file, and generate these single gzipped files dynamically for each request.

Sure, this approach is slow, but if you're only updating your blocklist once a day or once every 4 hours,
10-30 seconds isn't too long to wait IMO. These URLs work great in Transmission where you can only have one
blocklist URL.

The app encodes all the data it needs to combine the BLs in the query string, and was designed to use $_GET
so that you don't have to visit the site again once you have the URL -- just re-download the URL to refresh
your blaze.

Need some P2P blocklist URLs? I hear that Google knows where to find some.

The UI is in gen.html . You should only have to use this when you want to generate a new combined blocklist URL.
Once you generate a URL, you can just issue an HTTP GET request to it ("download it" / "open it up in a browser")
to trigger a rebuild of the list. It'll send the file to you as a download when it's all set.

==== SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS ====
1.) A web server (like Apache) with internet access
2.) PHP 5.2 or higher with zlib support
3.) Magic Quotes should be disabled in PHP, but this is probably not required.

==== INSTALLING ====
1.) move or copy gen.html and parse.php into some directory on your webserver that supports PHP.
2.) edit the URL in gen.html on line 34 to point to the web-facing URI of parse.php. You'll need to change
'example.com' to the real address that you're hosting this on.

==== USAGE ====
Follow the instructions in gen.html
